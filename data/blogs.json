    "title": " Somalia Data Protection Authority (SDPA)",
    "content": "Introduction\nThe Somalia Data Protection Authority (SDPA), also known simply as the Data Protection Authority (DPA), is the independent federal body established to safeguard individuals’ privacy rights and regulate the processing of personal data within Somalia. Created under the Data Protection Act (Law No. 005 of 2023), the Authority oversees compliance with the Act, implements its provisions, and provides resources such as guidance, registration services, and training to both public and private sector entities. \nDPA\nWikipedia\n\nLegal Framework\nThe legal framework governing data protection in Somalia is primarily grounded in the Data Protection Act (DPA), enacted by the Federal Parliament and assented to by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on March 23 2023. Law No. 005 establishes key principles for lawful data processing—such as consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, and security—and grants individuals rights including access, rectification, erasure, and data portability. The Act applies to any processing of personal data by controllers or processors operating in Somalia or targeting Somali residents, while exempting certain activities like household purposes, public health emergencies, and law enforcement operations. \nWikipedia\nTech Hive Advisory\n\nEstablishment and Inauguration\nFollowing the enactment of the Data Protection Act, the SDPA began its preparatory work to operationalize the law. Although the Authority commenced many of its activities soon after the Act came into force in March 2023, it was officially launched on February 24 2024, in Mogadishu. The inauguration ceremony underscored Somalia’s commitment to digital transformation, with attendees from government, civil society, and the private sector reaffirming the importance of privacy and data protection in the country’s modernization efforts. \nInno Canyon\nAfrica Data Protection Blog\n\nMandate and Functions\nThe SDPA’s mandate encompasses a broad set of functions aimed at promoting and enforcing data protection. Core responsibilities include registering and licensing data controllers and processors, accrediting compliance organizations, and issuing detailed regulations to guide the implementation of the Act. The Authority also conducts awareness campaigns and training programs for businesses and public agencies, provides guidelines for data protection impact assessments, handles complaints and data breach reports, and carries out inspections and audits to ensure adherence to legal requirements. In cases of non-compliance, the SDPA has the power to impose administrative fines and corrective measures. \nDPA\nInno Canyon\n\nOrganizational Structure and Leadership\nAs an independent federal agency headquartered in Mogadishu, the SDPA is led by a Data Protection Commissioner supported by a Director General and a multidisciplinary staff. The Authority, which employs between 51 and 200 professionals—including legal experts, data engineers, and communications officers—reports directly to the President’s office while maintaining autonomous regulatory powers. Key leadership figures include Commissioner Mohamed Royal and Director of Communications and Data Protection Officer Hassan Abdi Mohamud, reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of the team charged with safeguarding Somalia’s digital privacy. \nLinkedIn\nWikipedia\n\nImplementation and Challenges\nImplementing robust data protection in Somalia presents challenges related to technological infrastructure, public awareness, and inter-agency coordination. To address these, the SDPA has published practical guidelines for organizations, recommending steps like creating data inventories, conducting risk assessments, and developing action plans for full compliance. Despite security concerns and resource constraints, these initiatives mark important steps toward establishing a culture of privacy and accountability across government bodies and private enterprises. \nAfrica Data Protection Blog\nInno Canyon\n\nInternational Alignment and Future Outlook\nLooking forward, the SDPA is poised to further strengthen its regulatory capacity and align Somalia with international best practices. Empowered by the Data Protection Act to enforce compliance and develop subsidiary regulations, the Authority is also a beneficiary of the World Bank–financed Somalia Capacity Advancement, Livelihoods and Entrepreneurship through Digital Uplift Project (SCALED-UP), which bolsters its institutional and technical capabilities. As Somalia’s digital economy evolves, the SDPA’s ongoing efforts will be vital in fostering trust, protecting citizens’ rights, and facilitating safe cross-border data flows.",
